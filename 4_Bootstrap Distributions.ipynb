    "Bootstrapping is, in some sense, the opposite of sampling from a population. Sampling treats your dataset as the population, and you generate a random subset. Bootstrapping treats your dataset as a sample and uses it to build up a theoretical population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrapping workflow is to generate a resample of the same size as the population, calculate a summary statistic, then repeat this to get a distribution of summary statistics."

Sampling in python


Python is widely used for inference statistics and hypothesis testing 
because of its sampling capabilities. In survey analysis and experimental 
design, it is a powerful method for drawing conclusions without having to 
survey the entire population. You will discover how to perform sampling 
in Python, from simple random sampling to more complex methods like 
stratified and cluster sampling, in this Sampling in Python course.
